# JSON Parser
This is a repository created to create, learn and test a json parser using various programming languages. <br>

# What is json ?
**JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation) is a ligtweight, text-based data interchange format. It si easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is often used to load data between a server and a web application or between systems in a structured format<br>

#Example

```json
{
"name" = "Kishore",
"age" = "19",
"skills" = ["python", "Computer Hardware"]
}
```

# What is JSON Parser?
A JSON parser is a tool that reads a JSON-formatted string and converts it into a data structure the host programming language can work with. For example, a JSON object can be parsed into a python dictionary, JavaScript object or equivalent in any language. <br>
In most languages, built-in libraries handle JSON parsing.<br>
However, in this project, we eill manually create a parser from scratch to understand how parsing works internally.

# GOALS
This project is designed for educational purposes to explore:
* Tokenization and syntax parsing
* Recursive descent parsing techniques
* GUI integration for usabilitu
* How JSON parsing works internally without relying on libraries

# Author
  This project is built and maintained my [Kishore](github.com/Mr-Kishore) as a hands-on exploration of parsers and GUI integration
